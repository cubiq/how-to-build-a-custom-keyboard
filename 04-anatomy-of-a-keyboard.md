## Keycaps

Keycaps could be the most critical aspect in keyboard building both from a cost and feasibility standpoint. No matter how brilliant your new custom layout is, if you can't find the right keycaps it will be only source of frustration.

The first thing to note is that you can't always place the keycaps in any position you want. If you look at a keyboard from a side you'll see that each row has its own profile and keys are sculpted with different angles.

That means that you can't put a key originally meant for the top row on the bottom; at least not without without messing the keyboard profile. That is true unless of course you use a "flat" keycap set.

Flat not-angled caps like [Signature Plastics DSA family](http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php) are a god-send for custom keyboard builders as keys don't have a predetermined row and you can move them around in any location. That is especially useful if you plan on changing the default letters staggering (in a [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Dvorak) layout for example) or if you are designing a split or ergonomic keyboard.

Another aspect to consider is the keycap size. Normally the smallest keys are the alpha-numeric (A-Z, 0-9), they are square(-ish) and their size is referenced as _1 unit_ or simply 1u. Every keycap on a keyboard is built around the base size of a 1u.

Modifiers (`ctrl`, `alt`) are usually 1.25u; if the unit is 18mm wide the modifiers are 22.5mm (18×1.25); `tab` is 1.5u or 27mm (18×1.5); `backspace` is 2u or 36mm and so on and so forth. This is a very convenient when designing a keyboard or a keycap set.

You shouldn't have much troubles finding the alphas in both flat and sculpted family, but it can be very problematic to source symbols, modifiers, spacebar, `enter`, `tab`, ... in a size that is not the standard one. This is true for Cherry MX that is the most common switch, let alone for more extravagant ALPS or vintage switches.

The community has been very active these last few years, first of all check if in the past it has been organized a group buy^[Manufacturers have usually a high Minimum Order Quantity (or MOQ) which makes impossible for individuals to place small orders directly. To meet the MOQ enthusiasts gather together and place an aggregated order in what is called a _group buy_.] that includes the keys you need. DSA Retro, Granite and Round 5 & 6 are all known to feature the weirdest key sizes.

Another option is to have a set printed at [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/); they offer an interesting customization tool that lets you design the legends in any way you want.

If you need even more unique keys the next step would probably be to 3D print or custom build them somehow, but that is a bit over the scope of this manual.

The moral of the story is: before going crazy with super complicated layouts, check if you can find all the keycaps you need!
