## About this book

This book is intended for makers. We will cover some theory but you'll learn mostly by getting your hands dirty. After a few introductory chapters we'll jump right into keyboard modding and building.

We will follow a project-based approach: each chapter will guide you through building something new from the ground up and by the end of this manual you'll be able to plan, design, solder, program your own custom computer keyboard from scratch.

It might seem overwhelming but I'll guide you on each step. I won't leave no stone unturned: you'll know exactly what tools and components are needed, how to design a switch plate and where to get it laser cut, how to pick the right switches, how to solder, how to program the firmware, how to build the case and how to make it look professional even by DIY standards.

There's a lot of ground to cover, let's stop fiddling around.

## About the author

My Name is Matteo _"matt3o"_ Spinelli and I'm a mechanical keyboard addict.

I always felt this craving for building and fixing things. When I was a kid I remember my father being not very fond of my urge to disassemble his expensive electronic devices, but I couldn't help it: I needed to know how they were made. If there was something moving, lighting, beeping I had to see what was the magic inside.

I ended up studying art. I know, apparently it doesn't make sense but I couldn't bear "wasting" 4-5 years in engineering; I wanted to jump right into it and build stuff. I consequently turned into a self taught generalist. I have a very basic understanding of electronics, I can vaguely hold a soldering iron, I can work my head around CAD and CAM software, I can work with CNC routers and 3D printers, but I'm really not an expert in any of those fields.

What I'm trying to say is that if I can build a keyboard from scratch, nothing stops you from doing the same. I have no superpowers and I haven't studied anything that made this task easier. I wrote this manual to share my five years experience in building keyboards and to hopefully spare you some of the mistakes I made.
